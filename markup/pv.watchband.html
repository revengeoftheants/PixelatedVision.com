	    		3D printing has fascinated me ever since I first learned about it, and I was excited to get the chance to model and print something for the first time after I received my <a class="contentLink" href="http://formlabs.com/products/our-printer">Formlabs Form 1 stereolithography printer</a> in 2013. Since one of the rubber straps for my <a class="contentLink" href="http://www.lexon-design.com/time/e8/lm88aw9-e8-optical-watch-aluminium.html">Lexon e8 watch</a> had developed a deep crack, I had a great opportunity to try my hand at creating a highly precise CAD model of a curved object, iteratively test the fit of prototypes by printing them at home, and then send the final design off to Shapeways for printing in their <a class="contentLink" href="http://www.shapeways.com/materials/strong-flexible">black Strong &amp; Flexible Plastic</a>.
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		Disappointingly the final product turned out to be unusable, as the Strong &amp; Flexible Plastic just isn't flexible enough for a watch strap. While printable rubber-like materials <a class="contentLink" href="http://www.incept3d.com/rubberelastomeric-overmolding--objet.html">do exist</a>, they are still uncommon and thus expensive.
